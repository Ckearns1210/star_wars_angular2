If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\r\n\t *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\r\n\t *   Examples:\r\n\t *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\r\n\t *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\r\n\t *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\r\n\t *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\r\n\t *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\r\n\t *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\r\n\t *   Examples:\r\n\t *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\r\n\t *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\r\n\t *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\r\n\t *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\r\n\t *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\r\n\t *   Example:\r\n\t *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\r\n\t */\r\n\tvar MdIcon = (function () {\r\n\t    function MdIcon(_element, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\r\n\t        this._element = _element;\r\n\t        this._renderer = _renderer;\r\n\t        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\r\n\t        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    /**\r\n\t     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\r\n\t     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\r\n\t     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\r\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\r\n *   Examples:\r\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\r\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\r\n *\r\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\r\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\r\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web.
